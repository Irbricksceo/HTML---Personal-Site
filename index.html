        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p> I am an aspiring software engineer with a strong interest in hands-on problem solving, with particular interests in Data Science, 
            User Experience, and Embedded Systems..  Most of my work experience has been in jobs 
            pertaining both to technical and customer service, and consider one of my strongest skills to be my ability to connect 
            with the customer and give them a positive experience that has them wanting to return. In my opinion, how you treat your 
            customers is paramount to developing the kind of trust that leads to referrals and repeat business.  I am presently studying 
            at <em>Kennesaw State University</em> with an expected graduation date of July 2021.</p>
